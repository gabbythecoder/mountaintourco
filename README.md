# Mountain Tour Co.

This is a fictional website as part of a project from Codecademy. 

This is my first time building a responsive website from scratch! Any input is much appreciated. 

Future plans - add a hamburger menu for mobile view. Still need to fix the background image under the nav bar as when width size expand, there is a gap between the nav bar and image.
